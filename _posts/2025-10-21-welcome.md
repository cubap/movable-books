Welcome to the Movable Books project! This site is dedicated to documenting and standardizing how we represent interactive and movable elements in digitized books using the IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) standards.

## What Are Movable Books?

Movable books encompass a wide range of interactive printed materials that include elements that can be manipulated by the reader. These include:

- Pop-up books with three-dimensional elements
- Books with rotating volvelles (wheel charts)
- Fold-out pages and maps
- Books with sliding panels or tabs
- Flip books and transformation sequences

## The Challenge

Traditional digitization approaches treat books as static, two-dimensional objects. However, movable books lose much of their meaning and interactivity when photographed as simple page images. This project aims to define standards for representing these interactive elements in digital form.

## Our Approach

We are using the IIIF Presentation API to model various types of movable book elements. By documenting use cases and providing example implementations, we hope to:

1. Enable better digital representations of movable books
2. Preserve the interactive nature of these cultural artifacts
3. Make them accessible to researchers and the public worldwide
4. Create a community of practice around digital movable books

## Get Involved

This is a collaborative effort! You can contribute by:

- Documenting new use cases
- Providing examples from your collections
- Sharing technical implementations
- Participating in discussions on GitHub and Slack

Every page on this site includes an "Edit this page" link that allows you to propose changes directly through GitHub. We welcome contributions from librarians, archivists, developers, and anyone interested in digital cultural heritage.

## Next Steps

Explore our [use cases](/use-cases/) to see how different types of movable book elements can be represented using IIIF standards.
